# Restaurant Management System API

## Project Overview
This is a Restaurant Management System built using **Core PHP** and **Laravel**, following the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Paradigm**. The system provides API endpoints to manage restaurant operations such as menus, orders, and restaurant details. Additionally, the system is deployed using **Docker** containers to ensure easy portability and deployment.

## Project Features
- **Users**: Different roles like Customer, Guest, and Admin.
- **Food Items**: Manage food items and categories.
- **View Menus**: API endpoint to view the list of available menus.
- **Create Orders**: API endpoint to create new orders.
- **Manage Restaurant Data**: Basic functionality to manage restaurant details.
- **Daily Feature Additions**: Gradually adding new features based on the needs of the project.
- **Fully OOP-based Architecture**: All components are developed following the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm.

## Technology Stack
- **Core PHP**: Used for basic structure and business logic.
- **Laravel**: Utilized for advanced features, a cleaner structure, and robust routing.
- **MySQL**: Database for storing restaurant, menu, and order data.
- **Postman & Swagger**: For API testing and documentation.
- **Docker**: For containerized deployment, ensuring easy portability and scalability.
- **Case Study**: A detailed case study to understand and analyze the requirements and solutions.
- **UML Diagram**: To visualize the system components and their interactions.
- **API Best Practices**: Following API development best practices to ensure scalability, security, and maintainability.


## Goal of the Project
The goal of this project is to enhance my skills and gain hands-on experience with new technologies. By implementing features using these technologies, development techniques, and software architecture, this practice will help me become more proficient in both back-end development and modern technological practices. I am already familiar with the technologies listed above, and now itâ€™s time to implement them in a real-world project.
