# Restaurant Management System API

## Project Overview
This is a Restaurant Management System built using **Core PHP** and **Laravel**, following the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Paradigm**. The system provides API endpoints to manage restaurant operations such as menus, orders, and restaurant details. Additionally, the system is deployed using **Docker** containers to ensure easy portability and deployment.

## Project Features
- **View Menus**: API endpoint to view the list of available menus.
- **Create Orders**: API endpoint to create new orders.
- **Manage Restaurant Data**: Basic functionality to manage restaurant details.
- **Fully OOP-based Architecture**: All components are developed following the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm.

## Technology Stack
- **Core PHP** (for basic structure and business logic)
- **Laravel** (for advanced features and cleaner structure)
- **MySQL** (Database for storing restaurant, menu, and order data)
- **Docker** (For containerized deployment)
- **UML Diagram**: To visualize the system components and their interactions

## Goal of the Project
The goal of this project is to enhance my skills and gain hands-on experience with new technologies. By implementing features using these technologies, development techniques, and software architecture, this practice will help me become more proficient in both back-end development and modern technological practices.
